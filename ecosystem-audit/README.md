## Summary
We are undertaking an audit of the overall IPFS information ecosystem in Q1 2020. This directory within the `community` repo acts as a holding pen for working documents, artifacts and commentary related to this effort as we work to ***intentionally design our community***: *where* people find us, *how* they are able to interact with us in those places, and how those interactions can become more *consistent*, *systematic* and *empowering*.

## Mission
To further the IPFS-wide H1 2020 goal of **investing in community enablement** by *evaluating* our current information ecosystem, *identifying* opportunities for delivering the most value to our community, and *recommending* ranked next steps.

## Methodology/framework
The overall framework for this audit focuses on examining the existing resources, needs and expectations, pain points, and potential action around three key pillars: **stakeholders**, **workstreams**, and **channels**.

### Stakeholders
Within the context of this audit, **a *stakeholder* is anyone with an interest or concern in IPFS.** Because we to some degree want IPFS to be synonymous with the decentralized Web in the long-term future, and because we hope that "the decentralized Web" becomes simply "the Web", this suggests that *everyone* will be a stakeholder of some sort at some point — at least until the dweb becomes as ubiquitous and invisible as running water or electricity. We can't boil the ocean to that degree within this audit, but we do wish to consider a wide variety of stakeholders, for example:
- Ordinary, dweb-curious folks who just want a basic idea of why the dweb is better than the web we have now
- Non-technical (or non-dweb-technical) business users who want to know how IPFS can further their wider goals, and who have the decision-making power to encourage or discourage adoption of IPFS among the developers and other technical users in their communities/businesses
- Developers and other technical users in direct interaction with IPFS; *note that this group contains a wide gamut of permutations and will need to be mapped out in more depth, some of which is outside the scope of this audit*

As part of OKRs (see below), this audit will define at a basic level our major stakeholder groups, as well as the channels they may be most likely to use and their importance/value to the IPFS project in the near-, medium-, and long-term.

### Workstreams
Within the context of this audit, **a *workstream* is the course of action that a stakeholder takes in order to resolve their IPFS-related need.** As noted above in our discussion of stakeholders, the number of workstreams existing for examination could potentially be infinite. For the sake of initial examination, we will consider workstreams that represent near-term needs, as well as others we consider to potentially be particularly critical to our success in the medium- or long-term. For example ...
- Gathering information in order to make a high-level decision about whether IPFS is a good fit. *A product owner needs to determine whether IPFS is the best fit for an application's file storage needs. The product owner has a variety of specific concerns: some examples might include whether IPFS can be incorporated into the existing application without too much architectural change; whether IPFS will be sufficiently long-lived and ubiquitous a technology to be worth the effort; and whether the product can still meet its industry's security expectations if it uses IPFS. To reach a conclusion, the product owner would like to learn about analogous products that already use IPFS, and how; high-level, view primarily non-technical summaries of potential IPFS tech stacks that can be validated with the product's dev team; and scan documentation, forums, and other community resources to be assured that IPFS is here to stay.*
- Resolving a specific development-related problem. *An entrepreneur programmer working on a side-hustle app needs to troubleshoot an issue they encounter while hacking on IPFS on a Saturday morning. To get help quickly and accurately, they need complete, up-to-date, thorough documentation to help get them started; an active global (and thus time-distributed) community of developers potentially available to advise on specifics; and readily available forums for these discussions, including well-indexed IPFS forums, IPFS-centric IRC, and Twitter.*
- Learning about the potential value of IPFS in a context outside the usual use cases. *A city comptroller wants to follow up on a recommendation they are given in a city council meeting that city infrastructure maintenance records should be "put on IPFS". To learn what that actually might mean, and to answer some immediately occurring questions like "is that secure?" and "will it save money over AWS?", they need to read/watch a friendly explainer to the dweb on ipfs.io (the first Google result for "IPFS"), gain a basic understanding of the postential benefits of IPFS through FAQ content or quick topical explainers, and find some next-level-deeper information on IPFS that they can forward to their IT team.*

As part of OKRs, this audit will define near-term workstreams as well as potentially critical medium- and long-term workstreams, and note both the stakeholders most likely to be involved and the channels most likely to be utilized in resolving each workstream.

### Channels
Within the context of this audit, **a *channel* is any location in which someone may be talking about IPFS *upon which we may have some degree of control or influence*.** For example ...
- A dinner party where someone mentions IPFS probably doesn't count as a channel (unless someone in the IPFS community is at the party!)
- An IPFS-related conversation between developers on Twitter counts as a channel *if* we have the resources to monitor for that conversation and a playbook in place for consistent, helpful ways to nudge our way into that conversation
- The [ipfs.io](https://ipfs.io) website is without doubt a channel: We create and maintain the website, we have total control over the messaging, etc

As part of OKRs, this audit will discover and spell out currently existing channels, including the degree to which we *currently* have influence/control and the amount of effort/resource (particularly monitoring) required to establish an optimal degree of effectiveness.

## Q1 2020 Objectives and Key Results (OKRs)
The items outlined below represent the deliverables of this audit effort.

**OBJECTIVE #1:**  Define the landscape of our existing information ecosystem.
- **Result #1:** We define at a basic level our major stakeholder groups, as well as the channels they may be most likely to use and their importance/value to the IPFS project in the near-, medium-, and long-term.
- **Result #2:** We define near-term workstreams as well as potentially critical medium- and long-term workstreams, noting both the stakeholders most likely to be involved and the channels most likely to be utilized in resolving each workstream.
- **Result #3:** We discover and spell out currently existing channels, including the degree to which we *currently* have influence/control and the amount of effort/resource (particularly monitoring) required to establish an optimal degree of effectiveness.

**OBJECTIVE #2:**  Examine and evaluate this landscape for current and potential future effectiveness.
- **Result #1:** We examine the landscape we have defined to find high-value channels, stakeholders, and workstreams, as well as supporting resources that impact the value of multiples of these (such as a communications playbook or UI styleguide). Value can be indicated by repetition or overlap within the overall landscape (such as a channel that appears again and again) or by identifying channels/stakeholders/workstreams that are significantly underserved (such as a high volume of support enquiries on IPFS forums, but no playbook or human resources for resolving them).
- **Result #2:** We note the timeframe in which these high-value items provide their value: near, medium, or long? Does value fade away over time, or continue to grow?

**OBJECTIVE #3:**  Generate and rank recommendations for execution in Q2 and beyond.
- **Result #1:** We formulate high-level recommendations for serving or resolving the high-value items identified in Objective #2, including the time, effort, human/technical resources, and potential org-chart impact required by each.
- **Result #2:** We rank these recommendations based upon a balance of potential impact versus existing resources (and the potential for obtaining additional resources). These ranked recommendations are used to make execution decisions for Q2 and beyond.

## Milestones

- **End January:** OKRs defined and agreed upon; research initiated. 
- **End February:** Initial high-level research complete and visible in rough form in the ["Artifacts"](#Artifacts) list below.
- **End March:** Research refined as time permits and consolidated into summary report and ranked high-level recommendations. 
  - Report/recommendations artifact will be presented in a format that makes it simple to excerpt and present in other context-critical settings (e.g. recommendations germane to a particular working group should be easily removed from the whole for presentation on their own to that working group).

***A note on triage:** As this is research and exploratory work, it may be pre-empted due to tactical urgencies or other unforeseen circumstancces. If this is the case, our approach will be to continue to reach the milestones stated above, but at a lower level of granularity. With this in mind, our approach to this audit as a whole will be iterative — to start at the broadest level, and continue to refine to the degree time permits.*
