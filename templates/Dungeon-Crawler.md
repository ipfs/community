## Project Description
<!--Describe your project in a few sentences. -->
Dungeon Crawler is a story based RPG game that 
1. Users connect their Metamask wallet with the game.
2. Users have three lives which can be seen on the top left with the heart emoji.
3. There are lots of monsters, traps in the game which are to be avoided, users have a weapon as well (using the spacebar key will throw knives).
4. Enemies can be killed with knives and chest be collected in the game.
5. The chest directly transfers the Dungeon coins which are ERC20 tokens to the user's wallet. In order to win the game, the user has to find and collect the LINK   token which is somewhere on the map protected by an evil angel.
6. On successfully clearing the game a user is rewarded with NFT which is minted with help of Chainlink VRF.
Tips : To go through the door user need to find a key that can be gained by helping the wizard and killing the evil angel.
5. All the minted NFTs metadata are stored on IPFS.
6. User has his/her cabinet where he/she can view the rewards earned and which are required for access to the next level.
7. Dungeon Crawler has a Dao as well where users can contribute to the game.
8. User(artist, creators) can contribute to the platform with assets like game characters, maps, monsters, etc.
9. Artists fill the form with specific requirements and wallet address which is displayed on the game dashboard.
10. Users can vote the maps, scenarios, and characters for the game by submitting the dungeon coin.
11. On a particular timeframe epoch we calculated the highest voted character and transfer the amount of dungeon token to the creator.

## Project Status
<!--brainstorming, fundraising, under development, beta, shipped, etc-->
Under development (75%) Need to create a DAO, marketplace for users and creators for creating scenes/stories/maps/legends and NFT rewards and metadata should be hashed and stored on the distributed web using IPFS and Filecoin decentralised cloud storage.
