## Notes
 - Calls biweekly, issue will be created with agenda topics that need to be covered
 - CID (content ID)
 
##  Action items
- CID
  - [ ] more time
  - [ ] implementation
  - [ ] write its own spec
 - [ ] discuss where CIDs belong to (multiformats, IPLD, ?)




----
Ref prefixing of paths

1. For the notion of linking between protobuf to protobuf there is an implicit CID of v0, protobuf, base58. To allow for the 
  integration of other raw objects, like git objects we need this implicit thing as well. Given that then all links inside networks
  are using implicit CIDs, except for IPLD do we want to do the same thing for IPLD inside links?
2. Do we need to use /ipld/<cid>  or <cid> for linking to IPLD objects inside IPLD objects?
