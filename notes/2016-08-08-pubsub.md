# Pubsub notes

## Pre-readings
- PubSub discussions so far: https://github.com/ipfs/notes/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3Apubsub
- PubSub repo -> https://github.com/libp2p/pubsub

## Background
- How do you get fast and (reliable?) communication amongst peers that subscribe to a particular content?
- Everyone that builds on top of IPFS requires pub/sub
  - e.g. social networks (orbit, ethereum community!)

## Requirements for PubSub v1
- Subsecond Latency
- Small networks (thousands of notes)
- No? need for packet switching
- There are a few proposed implementations (links?)
  - Authenticated streams (data model)
- Way of subscribing and getting notification
- Survive the massive amount of churn in browsers!
- Minimize flood (receiving the same message multiple times)
- Authentication MAY wait

### TODO
- Design
  - [ ] list down a list of requirements
  - [ ] do we need authenticated streams?
  - [ ] Use cases https://github.com/ipfs/2016-Q3-Workshop/issues/17#issuecomment-235006729
  - [ ] Identify simplest possible implementation
    - e.g. given an annuouncement channel, find a way to form into clusters
      that just need a partial view (needed for Orbit)
  - [ ] Iron down authenticated streams
  - [ ] Trying to identify the different layers
- Implementation
  - [ ] create a shared document and start implementing prototypes
  - [ ] Testing: Build very basic implementations and a way to spin up a network with thousand of nodes
  - [ ] Write down a BIG ISSUE about IPLD

## Lit-review outcome
- Little progress
- Understand concept of treeforming
- We should focus on topic-based pubsub
- Select small spanning trees with not too much effort

## Questions
- q: What happened with ethereum?
  - a: not sure what worked
  - a: we may need a post-mortem (there are already papers)
  - a: not sure if it supports that big of a network

## Layers
- Defining the **interface** for pubsub
- Defining the **data model** for pub/sub (mikola/nicola) https://github.com/ipfs/notes/issues/154
