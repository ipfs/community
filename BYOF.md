## Project Description

BYOF is the open social graph standard of web3

BYOF (bring your own friends) allows users to follow ethereum addresses ang get followed back.

Twitter, Discord and any centralized social media platform keep their social graphs closed. If Discord suddenly shuts down, all your Discord contacts are lost. If you want to leave Twitter you cannot bring your contacts with you. Today there's nothing that gives users ownership on their lists of following/followers and make it portable from platform to platform.

With BYOF you can seamlessly bring your followers to any web3 platform. On the other side, developers can integrate BYOF to import already existing networks.

Let's take Decentraland as potential use case.

Right now once you connect to Decentraland you have to manually enter the addresses of people you want to interact with. If after a week you wanted to move to another platform you have to start from 0 again. If Decentraland would integrate BYOF, you could import your followers (and followings) and start hanging around with them. If you meet someone cool in Decentraland you can start following them: they will always be part of your social graph, beyond Decentraland.

Every web3 application that involves network of people will, eventually, adopt BYOF.

BYOF has 2 components:

- A Dashboard where you can track the address you follow. You can check the DAOs they are part of, the NFTs they own and trading, the web3 games they are playing or the metaverse platforms where they are hang around (part of the MVP).
- An open API that can be integrated within any web3 platform that relies on social networks (not part of the MVP).

BYOF unlocks: 
- **censorship resistant ownership** upon your list of followers
- **portability and composability** across web3 protocols
- **privacy** guaranteed by asymmetric cryptography

## Use of IPFS, Filecoin and Libp2p

BYOF uses IPFS as the core building block of its infrastructure.
The data structures that cointain information about user's followings are addressed via IPFS. BYOF uses Ceramic's data streaming network to store, update and mutate content.

## Project Status
MVP 

## Previews
Here's a demo of the MVP https://youtu.be/d0n9Ojuqs-8

## Target Audience
It is twofold: 
1) for users, as a way to control their audience and friends. 
2) for developers, as a way integrate into their platform already existing social graph. Most likely the use cases will be in gaming, social media and metaverse platforms. 

## Rough estimated user base (if applicable)

## How to Contribute

Looking forward to get feedback and help from the community. The Next Step I'm planning to take with grant support is to create a TheGraph index over Ceramic streams in order to let third parties access open social graph and integrate in within their platforms
