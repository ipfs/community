## People

IPFS is an open source project with a large and open community. Listing out all the names of the contributors would result in a very long list, so we made a very large hex grid instead!

The grid keeps growing, find the latest always at the [Contributors Hex Grid repo](https://github.com/ipfs/contributors-hex-grid#interplanetary-contributors-webpage).

### IPFS Event Materials
Want to host an event to share IPFS with others, or bring IPFS to another event? Feel free to use these materials to make your event(s) awesome! Everything here is [Creative Commons 4.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/) - so feel free to adapt or remix!

- **How IPFS Works Overview:** [@stebalien](http://github.com/stebalien) created a great presentation template for "[How IPFS Works (approximately)](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1wyrTNTERJV23R7PyLrNloBauygdq1SXerijvEUG62xI/edit)". _Feel free to reuse or fork this deck to help break down the inner magic of IPFS for others._ [Here's a recording](https://youtu.be/0IGzEYixJHk) of this deck being used in practice to explain how IPFS works (from the October 2019 Osaka IPFS Meetup).
  - Still have questions? [IPFS Simply Explained](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Uj6uR3fp-U) does a great job visualizing how IPFS addresses some key use cases and needs to upgrade the internet.
- **IPFS Deep Dive Workshops:** These two videos - [How IPFS Deals with Files](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z5zNPwMDYGg&list=PLuhRWgmPaHtSsHMhjeWpfOzr8tonPaePu&index=2&t=0s) and [The Lifecycle of Data on the Dweb](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fLUq0RkiTBA&list=PLuhRWgmPaHtSsHMhjeWpfOzr8tonPaePu&index=3&t=8s) - are great workshops on how core components of the IPFS network fit together. Feel free to watch these together, or just use as inspiration.
- **Context and Vision for IPFS:** In [Why IPFS?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zE_WSLbqqvo) and [Building Web3](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJOG5Ql7ZD0), Juan Benet talks about how IPFS fits into a longer-scale evolution of technology and our progress on building the new set of capabilities to power web3. The amazing video in "Why IPFS" that sets the stage for our place in the cosmos is "[Our Story in 1 Minute](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZSt9tm3RoUU)" by melodysheep.
- **IPFS Intro with Interactive Demo** [@NukeManDan](http://github.com/nukemandan) gives a basic overview and provides and interactive demo with [PeerPad](https://peerpad.net/) for the audience. Here is a [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3MjB45YZsM) to model after and the [slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1NyDePRHlP1Gqnf-5GvVAMnR4VFvbqVxAUH3lMsoHrB0/) used.

## Ecosystem Projects

If your project/product uses IPFS, you're in the IPFS ecosystem! We'd love to see all projects in the IPFS ecosystem be discoverable and used by the broader community! 

### Showcase Your Project!

Follow the steps below to submit your projects to be featured in this [repo](https://github.com/ipfs/community/tree/master/projects):
- Create a project profile here in the ipfs/community repository using the [project submission template here](https://github.com/ipfs/community/blob/master/templates/project-submission-template.md). Name the file name after your project and fill in as much information as you can.  Use your project name as the file name so the community can find your project easily!
- Create a project discussion in the Discussion board on this repo, with the category as `Show and tell - Developers`  and title as `[Category] Project Name`(i.e: `[Application] Slate`), link the discussion in the How the community can engage section of your project submission. This is to create a place to interact with the community, share your updates and gain feedback on your projects! If you update your project Discussion regularly, those updates can be picked up in the IPFS newsletter, social sharing, get invites to speak at IPFS meetups or other events, and more!
- Once the project profile is ready, create a [PR](https://github.com/ipfs/community/pulls), prefix `[Project Submission]` in the title
- If everything looks good, the repo maintainers will merge the PR and voila, as simple as that your project is now featured here!

### Updates and Newsletter

We'd encourage all projects featured in this repo to share all of your thrilling updates with the community! Start a new comment with header `Project Name Update/Newsletter - Date` (i.e `## Slate Update - Feb, 2021`) in your project discussion to share the exciting news with the community!
