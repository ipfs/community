## About

The IPFS community is growing, and already has many resources. We ought to maintain them, build more, and improve all the things. This repository is for meta, non-code discussions (in the [issues](issues)) and for documents used by multiple repositories, such as the various Contributing guidelines.

**NOTE:** If you're interested in discussing code, jumping on our community calls, or talking to developers about our overall project management, go to [ipfs/pm](https://github.com/ipfs/pm). We announce **our weekly calls** in the [ipfs/pm issues](https://github.com/ipfs/pm/issues). You can also open issues in specific repositories (like [go-ipfs](https://github.com/ipfs/go-ipfs)), and come talk to us on [IRC at #ipfs on freenode](http://webchat.freenode.net/?channels=%23ipfs).

## People

IPFS is an open source project with a large and open community. Listing out all the names of the contributors would result in a very long list, so we made a very large hex grid instead!

The grid keeps growing, find the latest always at the [Contributors Hex Grid repo](https://github.com/ipfs/contributors-hex-grid#interplanetary-contributors-webpage).
