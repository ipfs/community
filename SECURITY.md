# Security Policy

## Reporting a Vulnerability

The IPFS protocol and its implementations are still in heavy development. This means that there may be problems in our protocols, or there may be mistakes in our implementations. And -- though IPFS is not production-ready yet -- many people are already running nodes in their machines. So we take security vulnerabilities very seriously. If you discover a security issue, please bring it to our attention right away!

If you find a vulnerability that may affect live deployments -- for example, expose a remote execution exploit -- please send your report privately to security@ipfs.io, please DO NOT file a public issue.

If the issue is a protocol weakness or something not yet deployed, just discuss it openly.

## Reporting Abuse

To report **IPFS abuse** (e.g. using IPFS for malware hosting, distribution of questionable content, phishing purposes, etc.) please send an email to [abuse@ipfs.tech](mailto:abuse@ipfs.tech).
