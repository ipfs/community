Application

## Project Description
<!--Describe your project in a few sentences. -->

Real time, end-to-end encrypted, p2p messenger using go-IPFS-Pubsub. Allows private messaging & secure in-chat file/directory sharing. Server/broker-less (viz. no signaling/rendezvous server needed). Works over both LAN and internet (uses built-in NAT-traversal, if needed).

## Use of IPFS, Filecoin and Libp2p
<!-- Describe how your project uses any or all of these technologies, and why. -->

Nodes discover peers primarily by querying the DHT for providers of a time-based rendezvous file. Every node also resolves the same libp2p-keys over IPNS-Pubsub to prime the swarm. Uses IPFS-Pubsub both for the chatroom and further peer discovery. Uses IPNS over Pubsub for peer authentication.

## Project Status
