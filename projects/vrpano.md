## Use of IPFS, Filecoin and Libp2p
<!-- Describe how your project uses any or all of these technologies, and why. -->
**How do we plan to use IPFS and Filecoin?**

- We provide more than just retrieval, we also provide IPFS to HTTP traffic interface.
- Users can directly access VR and AR scene display through IPFS, but also through the traditional HTTP retrieval access.

**What's our services?**

We provide 3D data storage management, transfering, and displaying service. We support varies of formats for 3d data, such as:
- Panoramic Data
- VR Movie Data
- AR Model Data
- 3D Character Model Data

## Target Audience
<!--Describe who will be your project's users-->
Photography studio, Panorama SaaS, Online Gallery, VR Studio etc

## Rough estimated user base (if applicable)
<!--How many users do you have right now?-->
Our users are mainly in China, and 44GB of data has been Pined on FFS/IPFS.
It is well known that Jingdezhen is the capital of porcelain, so our main customer is Jingdezhen Ceramic Museum, Jingdezhen Ceramic Industrial Park, Tao Xichuan Creative Park.
The solution has been proven to be popular with users, and we will continue to iterate and upgrade to provide better service.
