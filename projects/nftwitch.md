## Project Description
NFTwitch allows Twitch streamers to mint NFTs as they grow their follower count, verified via Chainlink calls to the Twitch API. These exclusive collectibles can be given away or sold to fans. The streamer benefits from the immediate source of income, and the fan benefits from exclusive perks to NFTwitch holders. Upon transfer of the NFTwitch, the perks are also transferred to the new owner. This creates an ecosystem that helps low-income streamers stay afloat, and rewards fans both immediately and in the long-term as the streamer grows in popularity.

## Project Status
Beta is live on Rinkeby testnet

## Target Audience
Twitch Streamers and their fans. Streamers will use the dapp to generate NFTs to be given away or sold to fans.

## Rough estimated user base (if applicable)
Potentially as large as Twitch's user base, but right now it's just me.

## How to Contribute
Reach out to your favorite Twitch streamer and let them know about this dapp! We also need more Chainlink nodes using the Twitch external adapter to help decentralize the network. On the programming side, we need to check the smart contracts for any issues, improve the UI and UX on the front-end, and integrate Layer 2 solutions to reduce gas fees. And suggestions for new features, especially involving IPFS, are always welcome!
