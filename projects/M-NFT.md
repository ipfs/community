## Project Description
<!--Describe your project in a few sentences. -->
"M-NFT" is a modified smart contract (M-NFT) technology for NFT tokens. 
Tokens created and transferred to M-NFT can place an additional layer 
(mask) on top of the original image. The technology will allow NFT to 
be modified to meet the demands of the advertising business, and can 
also be used in crypto gaming, collective creativity and copyright 
protection. NFT Tokens can be both created and transferred to M-NFT using the service of the same name.
