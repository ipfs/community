## Project Name
CID-Management-Web-App

## Category 
Web Application

## Project Description
Art galleries need ways to certify the authenticity of physical pieces sold to customers. Using IPFS and ERC-721 tokens, GalaxyX has built a simple web-app that art collectors can use to login and view their certificates (CID's) that are issued by the gallery. We are using this simple web-app to be one of the buillding blocks for data verification tools built with IPFS and Filecoin. 

## Use of IPFS, Filecoin and Libp2p
We use IPFS on the back-end to store and serve the metadata for the ERC-721 tokens that are acting as the digital COAs. The ERC-721 metadata hosted on IPFS and Filecoin are linked within our react app for users to view themselves. We save the data on IPFS because we want our data decentralized and available.<!-- Describe how your project uses any or all of these technologies, and why. -->
