## Project Description
The idea is to create a decentralized GitHub on Blockchain and IPFS/Filecoin. A Smart Contract represents the git
repository and stores all important information. The files of the repository on the other hand are currently pushed
to IPFS.
You might ask yourself: Why Github on Blockchain?
Here are a few arguments why I believe that having such a system on Blockchain makes sense:
 - Many open sources developers have a donate button. You are able to send a donation through a third party app to them.
I would like to eliminate the need for a third party app. Every repository has a donation button integrated - from the beginning
 -  Open issues and attach a bounty. Are you using an open source package and have a bug/idea/issue with it? Open an issue
 and leave a bounty for a developer. This incentives developers to resolve issues faster and earn some money, maybe allowing
 them to spend more time to develop their code. Another example is given here: [IPFS Devgrants](https://github.com/ipfs/devgrants/blob/master/README.md)
 Read the Bounty section ;)

## Use of IPFS, Filecoin and Libp2p
Git3 uses currently IPFS to store the files of a repository. The future idea is to use CID for all internals of git,
making use of IPFS's benefits, like deduplication.

## Project Status
I started with it during an EthGlobal hackathon. Since then I rewrote most parts of the code, published a git3 Python client,
and deployed the Smart Contracts to a testnet (Polygon Mumbai). The idea is to get it into a MVP stage within the next 3 months,
so users can start to use it.

## Target Audience
In the beginning, I would like to get some projects from web3 into Git3 so that there is a way to support those guys
work easily. But we are open to have everyone who wants to use the platform to use it.

## Rough estimated user base (if applicable)
None, since it is not up and running.
