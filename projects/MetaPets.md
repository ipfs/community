 This project won the first place for the Mercury Hackathon in the video game category: https://angelhack.com/blog/announcing-mercury-hackathon2021-winners-%f0%9f%8e%89.html/

## Use of IPFS, Filecoin and Libp2p
Artists will paint on 3D animals models directly in the browser, the painting are actually JPG files base64 encoded that are stored in IPFS (web3.storage).

## Project Status
Beta => users can already paint on the MetaPets and submit their artwork which will give them a unique link to share to the world so everyone can admire their piece of art!
