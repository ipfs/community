## Project Name 
TrueBlocks / Unchained Index

## Category 
Infrastructure, Public Good, Indexing Solution

## Project Description
- TrueBlocks is an open-source project which includes an indexing solution for any blockchain, better explained [here](https://trueblocks.io/docs).
- Unchained Index is a collection of techniques within TrueBlocks that uses IPFS and an Ethereum smart contract to produce, publish, and distribute the index in a Web 3.0 native way.
- By "Web 3.0 native" we mean it is (a) reproducible, (b) uncapturable, (c) private by default, and (d) most importantly, cheap.
- Using IPFS, and without the user's intervention, the index is naturally, cheaply and equitably distributed as heavy users of the chain carry a heavier burden and lighter users of the chain carry a lighter burden.
- Unlike other index providers, Unchained Index seeks to treat chain data like a "public good" by limiting dependency on central gatekeepers, retaining the immutable nature of the chain data and, promoting cheap and widespread data access to the chain data.

## Use of IPFS, Filecoin and Libp2p
- Unchained Index leverages IPFS to broadly distribute the index of the chain data cheaply, securely, verifiably and decentrally.
- Currently, we use Pinata as a pinning services, however, we wish to explore the use of FileCoin as a pinning service.

## Project Status

- Unchained Index was conceived and initially developed as part of ETHGlobal HackFS in August 2020. We received a prize for our work from Pinata.
- It remains under active development and is an intergral building block of TrueBlocks, including its use in our [Account Explorer](https://github.com/TrueBlocks/trueblocks-explorer) application.

## Target Audience

- Trueblocks and the Unchained Index are broadly applicable to many users. Being an indexing solution for blockchains in general, and the Ethereum mainnet in particular, anyone can use the data we produce. 
- Our primary audience is ultimately 'regular users', meaning individuals looking for fully-local access to blockchain data without reliance on any third party (including ourselves).

## Rough estimated user base (if applicable)

- Being alpha software, we have no users in production but many interested potential users and active conversations in our Discord.
