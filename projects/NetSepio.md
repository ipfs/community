## Use of IPFS, Filecoin and Libp2p
<!-- Describe how your project uses any or all of these technologies, and why. -->
We use IPFS to store the metadata of the reviews submitted by user, further we use TheGraph indexer which used IPFS for storing data created by the events which allows us to stay in decentralized ecosystem while providing the graphql APIs, also we create web archieves on IPFS for every review thats get submitted.
