## Project Name 
Deagle

## Category 
Application

## Project Description
Deagle is an NFT options protocol. Using deagle, a user can speculate, hedge and earn income on his/her NFT. Instead of trading NFTs, trade the option to buy or sell an NFT at a strike price before a maturity date. NFT options data is stored in IPFS.
There will be two types of user, 
Option Seller : He is the person who has the nft so he can either mint a put option to hedge his/her nft(we call it NFT protection) or mint a call option to speculate and earn income on his/her NFT.
Option buyer: He is the person who is going to buy an option from any secondary marketplace and can settle it on our application if his option expires in the money. 

## Use of IPFS, Filecoin and Libp2p
NFT options metadata is stored in IPFS. This metadata includes option strike price, option expiry timestamp and long short pair address (unique for a set of strike price, expiry date and underlying nft, required for option settlement).

## Target Audience
Problems faced by NFT enthusiasts are:
- Good NFTs are very expensive.
- No income on idle NFTs.
- No protection from the downside if the NFTs starts to lose its value.
To take advantage of the high volatility in NFTs without needing lumpsum amount of money, Options would be a great fit. 


## Rough estimated user base (if applicable)
Application is just live on testnet. Planning to make it live soon as the demand for it seems to be rising.
