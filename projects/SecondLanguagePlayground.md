## Team Info
We are a couple. When pandemic starts Marcela and other teachers struggle to teach using different technologies aroud the web, some of those tools were paid and hard for other teacher to understand and use.
Our idea is to use both knowledge to create open-source playgrounds where teachers could use them to teach students a second language.
