## Project Name
Lifefram (formerly known as Peopedia)

## Category 
Application

## Project Description
We're building a global decentralized database to store records of the deceased for 300 years and beyond. Knowledge should last forever, including the knowledge of us.

## Use of IPFS, Filecoin and Libp2p
We use IPFS to ensure biographies are stored in a decentralized manner across different nodes. Any IPFS nodes are free to duplicate our data on their nodes.

## Project Status
Beta version is live at https://lifefram.org

## Team Info
The idea of this project got started when our founder tried to write a biography of his departed aunt on Wikipedia. Sadly, the article was rejected because his aunt was not considered a notable person. Which gave him the idea to create this platform where anyone could memorialize anyone else who has passed away. 

Our mission is to manage a global decentralized database to document those who have passed away permanently and persistently for 300 years and beyond. 

To ensure every biography would last forever, we’ve set out to build a platform that is redundant and decentralized from any central authority. With this aim, we’ve built a data storage network based on decentralized storage system that is independent from operating system and geographic location with more independence foreseeable in the future, thus ensuring that even after we’re gone, the knowledge of us shall continue to persist in this world.
