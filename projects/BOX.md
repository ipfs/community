## Project Description
<!--Describe your project in a few sentences. -->
We package decentralized web in a gadget, a personal server, giving users privacy, versatility and the new UX of the decentralized web. BOX is a form factor, and not just a file server, but a whole apliaction server, which replaces home clouds.
Unlike traditional home clouds or NAS, it does not require statis IP or domain name to access the files and data. It aims to fill the gap between people and web3.

## Use of IPFS, Filecoin and Libp2p
<!-- Describe how your project uses any or all of these technologies, and why. -->
We use libp2p to connect Javascript based applications (react native and react) designed for BOX, with the BOX back end. 
Then we synchronize the files between multiple BOXes, and server the encrypted files to the users through IPFS and IPFS cluster. 
Finally we provide a layer for BOX users to be bale to conenct to filecoin, to have a decentralized backup of their data.

## Project Status
<!--brainstorming, fundraising, under development, beta, shipped, etc-->
We have completed the barinstorming and design phase, and currently completing development phase for the fist prototype. Our first application is a ![https://github.com/funcitonland/photos](Google Photos Alternative) which connects to BOX, which demo is ready and we are working on building ![https://github.com/functionland/box](a library on top of libp2p) for upload/download of photos from the app to/from the BOX.

## Target Audience
<!--Describe who will be your project's users-->
We have two main audeience. Individuals who can use the BOX instead of cloud or NAS to safely store their data and use the applications designed for BOX. 
The second target is front-end developers, who can use the APIs that BOX provides to have a p2p access to BOX data(files and database) and build decentralzied applications for users.

## Rough estimated user base (if applicable)
<!--How many users do you have right now?-->
The project is not live yet but our github page received around 400 stars and we have some subscribers to our newsletter.

## Github repo

## Team Info
<!-- Introduce your amazing team - how many team members are working on this project and who are they?-->
We actively started working on this project a year ago, as we thought this could be a changing technology. After completing the backend prototype by putting all pieces together(IPFS,IPLD, libp2p, proxy re-encryption), and testing with our first app(Photos), we feel confident that we have all pieces figured out and ready for the first production-ready prototype.
