Application (Social Media)

## Project Description
<!--Describe your project in a few sentences. -->
BraineumVerse is a mapping of the real world into the mind-space of BraineumAI, a pseudo AI, to simplify life and its interactions. Users provide the content which is mainly images at the moment. As the system develops additional social media platform group features like friends, groups, interests can be added. The creation of stores that may or may not exist in the real world is also important as that would drive ecommerce interactions which will be conducted in its own native currency. As interactions grow a pseudoAI can be developed to learn from key interactions and at some point take over and perform the mundane tasks.

## Use of IPFS, Filecoin and Libp2p
<!-- Describe how your project uses any or all of these technologies, and why. -->
The project currently uses Web3.Storage which uses both IPFS and Filecoin to store files that will be displayed to the user. A massive number of files could be saved and displayed in that manner as users will upload their images to these systems.

## Project Status
<!--brainstorming, fundraising, under development, beta, shipped, etc-->
