## Project Description

An on-chain proof-of-workout decentralised application to help people develop good fitness habits where people stake their crypto as a proof of their commitment, 
and upload their proofs on IPFS for a truly open and global accountability system. 

## Use of IPFS, Filecoin and Libp2p

Daily workout proofs (generated using smartphones or smart-watches) are submitted onto IPFS using pinata.cloud SDK to track daily progress of all participants as well as
create a system of immutable global accountability to make sure users reach their goals.

## Project Status

Under active development.
