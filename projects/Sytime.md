## Project Description
<!--Describe your project in a few sentences. -->
Sytime is decentralised chat application. 
Users can connect to our DApp with their Ethereum wallet, with an extension like Metamask.
Sytime allows users to create and edit personal accounts on the Ceramic platform leveraging decentralized identity
and user data sovereignty to interact with other users in a chat.
Users can also chat with others in different rooms and view the history of each room as well as send pictures to chat.
The list of rooms is also stored as part of the ceramic profile so users can keep their chat history handy in different browser sessions.

## Use of IPFS, Filecoin and Libp2p
<!-- Describe how your project uses any or all of these technologies, and why. -->
We use IPFS pubsub to chat and with everything connected to the chat.
Also we use Web3.Storage to store the history of messages.
We are deployed on Fleek! We also will use IPFS for share media like music/video and pictures.
